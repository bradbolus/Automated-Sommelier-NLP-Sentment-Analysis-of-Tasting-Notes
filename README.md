# Automated-Sommelier-NLP-Sentment-Analysis-of-Tasting-Notes
🍷 The goal of this project is to create a model which is able to take in an input in the way of a sommeliers description of a wine and output which ratings category that wine would fall into.🍷 Further investigation will be undertaken to see if my model could look at wine descriptions and output wine varietals and country of origin.
